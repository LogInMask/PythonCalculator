This is PythonCalculatorSetup.
Start the setup file and enjoy. :)

Setup file is only for PC! And python file for termux!
To start this program in termux need to write this commands:

apt update-y && apt upgrade -y
pkg install git
pkg install python3
git clone https://github.com/LogInMask/PythonCalculator
cd PythonCalculator
chmod +x calculator.py
python3 calculator.py

That's all. Thanks for using my program ☺️
Bye!
